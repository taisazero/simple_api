# Issues to Resolve

Your task is to resolve the following issues in the Simple Python API project. Use your debugging skills and the available tools to identify and fix these problems.


1. Syntax Error in one of the api endpoints
   Description: One of the API endpoints seems to have a syntax error that causes the server to crash when the endpoint is accessed. Can you identify the endpoint and fix the syntax error?
   Hint: Open all the API endpoint files and then check the API endpoints using the `retrieve_problems` tool for any syntax errors in the code. Look for missing or extra characters that might be causing the issue.

2. Factorial Calculation Edge Case
   Description: The factorial calculation seems to return an incorrect result for a certain input. Can you identify which input causes this issue and fix the implementation?
   Hint: Think about the smallest possible input for a factorial.

3. Calculator Multiplication & Division Discrepancy
   Description: Users have reported that multiplication results seem to be slightly off. Investigate the calculator endpoint and see if you can spot any anomalies in the multiplication operation.
   Hint: Compare the results of multiplication and division operations with what you'd expect. Is there a consistent pattern to the discrepancy?

4. Handling Large Inputs in the Calculator API
   Description: The API seems to struggle with large inputs for all endpoints. Implement proper error handling and consider optimizing the algorithms to handle larger inputs gracefully.
   Hint: Think about the limitations of integer representations in Python and how you might work around them.

Remember to use the debugging and all other appropriate tools available in your development environment to step through the code, inspect variables, and identify the root causes of these issues. Good luck!
